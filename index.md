Hi there! I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. at Peking University, with an expected graduation in June 2026. 

My research focuses on **AI4SE**, **LLMs for Code**, and **Code Generation and Representation through deep learning techniques**.

I am passionate about exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and software engineering, particularly how large language models can enhance code generation and representation.

Read more about me [here](/about/), or have a look at my [publications](/publications/).
