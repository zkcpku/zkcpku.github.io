  bio: |
    I'm passionate about leveraging large language models to enhance software engineering 
    and the way we generate and represent code. My research focuses on building powerful 
    code agents capable of end-to-end generation of production-ready code.

  mission: |
    I am now dedicated to building a powerful code agent capable of end-to-end generation 
    of production-ready code, joining outstanding counterparts like Claude Code in striving 
    to transform software engineering development workflows!
